      <h1 class="heading">Critical Reflection on Work</h1>
      <p class="p-note">
        This reflection will be about my work, and I will be critically analysing my work and the evolution of it over the course of the semester. 
        My first set of wireframes were simple, and at the time I remember thinking that they were quite good design-wise. Looking back at 
        some of them makes me question this thought. Keywords for my aesthetic are: feminine, floral, and flirty. I will 
        be explaining why in the skills page section below, but for now it is relatively important that you have this in 
        mind going into the site. Let's get into it:

        <br /><br />
        <h2>Homepage</h2>
        <br />
        My homepage design is simple and classic. Small paragraph at the top explaining the website, then a photograph of me with a brief description of myself. I chose to have a quote from a friend at the bottom of my webpage just above the footer. This is because as it is a website portfolio, if there was a product being advertised, it would be me and my skills. Often on product websites, there are customer reviews somewhere on the page. This was my way of bringing an equivalent to that to my site.
        <br /><br />
        <h2>Blog Page</h2>
        <br />
        My first design had my recent blogpage being large on the screen, and the others being in small boxes scattered around the page. The first issue
with this was that the larger box would then have to be filled with more text, meaning moving it to a smaller box would require a change in text. This also meant large 
amounts of blank space that didn't fit my vision. The only other option would then be to place an image in the box and I was trying to avoid using external images as much
as possible, as I feel like images related to the blog matter would not quite fit the 'feminine, vines, softness' aesthetic that I am cultivating. Instead, I changed the layout 
to all small boxes in three distinct columns on the page. Three not only felt fitting to the page (four meaning the boxes would be too small and 
two meaning they would look stretched) but also has religious signifigance in Hinduism as a lucky number.
<br />For the individual blog posts themselves, I chose to change the background. The background for the rest of the website is a sort of pink waterstain design. I mentioned before that
feminine is one of the keywords I was trying to convey in my design. To me this means oragnic shapes, softer colours, fonts that have character, and colour schemes that envoke a 
sense of comfort and softness. The waterstained backdrop means organic shapes and fits the soft pink colour-scheme. Keeping with this, I changed the background for the blogs to 
get the readers attention in a different way. The change would hopefully make them feel as though they are in a different environment, forcing them to pay attention to the words
in front of them. The backdrop is still pink, but there is no waterstain pattern to distract from or muddle the words. On either side there are green vines running vertically down
the screen. <br />This accomplishes two things: Firstly, the vertical lines encourage the eyes to move vertically, meaning they encourage the reading of my blogpost. Secondly, the 
vines continue to push the floral part of my aestethic. I originally had the text right-aligned. This raised many eyebrows in both the first and second submission. I attempted 
to justify this decision by explaining that difficult-to-read fonts are often used to make the reader focus on the words and thus absorb more of the information. There was no
evidence of this working the same for text-alignment and thus, I changed the text-alignment for my final submission. I still think that the right-aligned text looks more
feminine and soft as each sentence starting in a different place brings the feeling of organic shapes and softness that the rest of the website
is leaning into, however I cannot find any justification for it other than in my own strange concepts floating around my head.
        <br /><br />
        <h2>Design Page </h2>
        <br />
        My design page is a design page. Meaning, it is always going to be a work-in-progress. This meant making the wireframes look drawn onto the background of the website (by leaving 
the backdrop transparent and using a pencil-line) and the font look handwritten. The colour scheme was placed in the form of paint-smears with the exact hexcode in the center. 
This felt better than doing it using boxes, as once again I mention the love of organic shapes. My design choices after that are basically just lists of things with the choices
 written in. This provided the reader with a distinct list of the choices I had thought hard about and the ones I felt needed an explanation. 
Next would be the skills page
        <br /><br />
        <h2>Skills Page </h2>
        <br />
        I work/study in a very technological field. This means that my skills are essentially a list of languages, and very few skills descriptions 
that I could derive from my everyday experiences. What this means is that other candidates portfolios will likely have the same list of languages and skills. This was more of a challenge of 
standing out. Thus finally my reasoning for my aesthetic. Women have always been overlooked in most discussions, and this is true in the field of technology as well. Often 
women have no say, and those that do often have to hide anything feminine about them as it's seen as shameful and not belonging in the technological space. I am leaning the other way.
 There is no reason we cannot be feminine and also be excellent coders. My skills page attempts to bring this in. My font-choice is stylistic and (in my opinion) quite girly. 
My coding language experience is in years on a graph that, when the user clicks on the page, has the vines growing around them. My colour choice of purple for the font was to stand out against 
the pink background whilst still complimenting the colours. 
        <br /><br />
        <h2>Projects Page </h2>
        <br />
        I simply chose to display them in little shadow-boxes alternating in colour. I saw the feedback in the last submission was to allow the visitor of the site to 
see more of my work, but unfortunately I only have four games that I feel are polished enough to show on my site. I included an image/sprite from each game in the description to attract 
the readers attention, and under each description I wrote about the distinct coding challenges and skills learnt from each game. This will hopefully appeal to future employers because it shows my ability to think about each project, and analyse which skills I derived from them. 
        <br />
        Finally, the footer and the final words. I chose to redo each sites logo in colours from my website so that they fit the theme. The saturate in colour when the user hovers over them. This is
        to show that the user is indeed over them but in a subtle way that isn't enlarging the image or jarring to the users eyes.
        OVerall, I think that my work over the semester was good. I learnt a lot about cultivating themes and aesthetics, and I felt that my coding abilities were definitely improved by this course.
         Coding for things like responsiveness was something I had never considered had to be done for websites until I had to do it for this course. My writing skills did improve, though this was likely unnoticable as they 
        were pretty bad to being with in the first place. Overall, a lot happened. Technical-wise I didn't change much from my website, but design-wise a lot happened. Thanks for reading! :)
