        The internet in no longer new. It is no longer surprising to hear that
        someone owns a computer that can access the internet. We live in a
        digital age, which means that existing societal structures are being
        revamped constantly to fit into the new, internet-based,
        technology-filled space that we operate in. This digital migration is
        truly fascinating as the transparency of the internet allows us to find
        gaps in access very easily. There are of course pros and cons to the
        internet as a whole, just as there are with most things in life. There
        is a strange grey area in the middle that often gets ignored as well. In
        this critical writing, I will attempt to discuss these in depth to the
        best of my ability. The structure of this writing will be far stranger,
        looser, and terribly structured than the previous writings, as this
        reflects the chaotic nature of the internet, and the disorganised train
        of thought that needs to be followed when discussing these issues.

        <br /><br />

        I think the main way that the positive and negative aspects of the
        internet overlap is through the broadcasting of negative aspects. What
        exactly does that mean? Well, years ago when hate-crimes occured (they
        still do, of course) it was often a he said, she said situation. There
        was no tangible proof. Not only that, but victimes would often feel
        alone. The internet not only amplifies the voices of the victims and
        allows them to share their atories in spaces where they feel safe, but
        it also often punishes those responsible. The existence of online papers
        such as
        <a
          href="https://www.apc.org/sites/default/files/DueDiligenceAndAccountabilityForOnlineVAW.pdf"
          >this one</a
        >
        discussing accountability online for violence against women, or
        <a

        >
          this project</a
        >
        based around exposing and preventing hate speech online prove that
        victimes no longer have to feel entirely alone.

        <br /><br />
        Access to the internet is a problem explored in depth (or as much depth
        as I am capable of) in my previous article, but it is quite an important
        topic and falls into this section quite well. The coronavirus-19
        pandemic truly shed light on the volume of people that have no access to
        the internet. The UN (United Nations) declared access to the internet to
        be a
        <a
          href="https://www.article19.org/resources/access-to-the-internet-can-be-a-matter-of-life-and-death-during-the-coronavirus-pandemic/"
          >human right</a
        >
        in July of 2016 - which was almost exactly 6 years ago - and yet it took
        a pandemic that started 3 years later to prove tat this human right was
        not enforced. When the pandemic hit, we knew everything was going to
        change. This was entirely true, as three years later, the world before
        us has not returned to the way it once was. Many things that used to be
        done in person had to be adapted and placed online instead...which made
        the digital divide even larger. People who had no access to the internet
        but who used to have access to education suddenly were
        <a

        >
        their classes. Students who had parents that earned a higher income
        appear to have been able to have handled the transition better.
        Government spending on computers and internet access increased
        significantly in an attempt to help lessen the impact of the
        online-learning on the lower income students, but socioeconomic
        pressures meant this was not enough.
        <br /><br />
        For every dark cloud, there is a stream of sunlight. Though moving to
        online working and learning was difficult for many, this was a benefit
        to some. Those with
        <a
          href="https://theconversation.com/covid-is-changing-the-way-we-work-and-for-disabled-people-too-150670"
          >disabilities</a
        >
        who were often told that they could not work from home, were suddenly
        able to work at home. People with disabilities expressed online (often
        on Twitter) how the privleges they asked for, fought for, and were
        denied were suddenly entirely possible when able-bodied people needed to
        work from home. Though this is a dark look at how society and wthe
        working world disregards reasonable requests from those with
        disabilities and yet accepts it as reality quickly when those without
        disabilities require the changes, it is also a good thing that these
        changes could be made. <br /><br />
        On the other hand, these same groups are now expressing fear at the idea
        of losing these accomodations as the world attempts to continue as if
        the pandemic has ended. If the world did not burn when most of us worked
        from home, surely this means that we can continue this way? Businesses
        are doubtful.
