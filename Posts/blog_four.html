        Graham et al’s “Toward a study of information geographies” - A Close
        Reading
      </h1>
      <p>
        A suggested alternative title: We needed a study for this? Graham et
        al’s “Toward a study of information geographies” (which will be referred
        to as the paper for the rest of this piece) claims to be studying the
        distribution of information geographically, and to look at factors like
        access and representation. Information has to come from a source,
        therefore it will always have a geographical location of origin. The
        validity of the information, the participation, and the distribution has
        changed over time as the main media for accessing information has
        changed. The article/paper breaks this down into three distinct
        sections: geographies of access and enablement, geographies of
        participation, and geographies of representation. In this mini-essay, I
        will be discussing all of these in detail.<br /><br />
        {I’m not going to quote statistics from the paper back at you, the
        reader, as that doesn’t feel like a critical writing piece. Instead, I
        am merely here to describe the concepts, talk about conclusions, and
        maybe offer my own opinions. We were told to provide a ‘close reading’
        and this is described to be a quick overview of relevant themes in a
        paper, not more than two to three paragraphs in length. I shall attempt
        to keep this as short, concise, and informative as possible.} Fun Fact!:
        The ‘Global South’ is a term used to refer to all countries that are
        considered third-world. These are (coincidentally) also the countries
        where colonialism had a long-term impact. Probably not relevant though.
        <br /><br />Geographies of Access and Enablement:<br /><br />
        What are the geographies of Access and Enablement? It is a “map” showing
        the amount of people who have access to the internet and in which
        regions they are accessing the internet from. It is different from a
        traditional population map as just because an area has a large
        population, this does not always mean they all have access to the
        internet. In an ideal world and perfect utopia, everyone would be able
        to have equal say and influence on the world around them, but the sad
        truth is this isn’t so. Often, to be able to have an opinion, you will
        need to have access to information on whatever the topic at hand is. Not
        only that, but the content conveyed by a single person in real life will
        not be heard by many….but that same content online will reach (at the
        very least) dozens. <br /><br />Geographies of Participation:<br /><br />
        This section is exactly what it sounds like: the amount of people in
        each country that ‘participates/contributes’ to the internet. This means
        uploading content to the internet, be it through GitHub, or YouTube.
        Once again, in the perfect world, everyone would be able to express
        every thought and participate in online debates freely, but this isn’t
        always the case. This does bring me to an interesting tangent of
        censorship: Where do we draw the line? We say everyone should
        participate freely online, however does this mean we should condone hate
        speech? Racism? Sexism? Islamophobia? This is exactly what the paradox
        of tolerance involves. The tolerant do not draw a line, and thus often
        tolerate intolerance. But the intolerant obviously do not provide the
        same luxury to the tolerant. This is not quite related to the content,
        but does definitely make one wonder about participation in general. Not
        only that, but the countries with the highest participation rates are
        often tied directly into consumerism, with the richest, most heavily
        divided economically, capitalist hellscapes being the countries that
        have the most access to the internet. This could be viewed as companies
        taking advantage and pushing more advertisements onto the people of the
        country, but could also be the people of the country buying into it and
        spending more time online. America is the country with the highest
        participation rates, and this is not surprising. Americas political
        state means that regardless of what you believe in, expressing that
        belief online will often get lots of responses and backlash from those
        who oppose you, in comparison to those who do. It’s just like how people
        often do not take time to go online to leave a review about a good
        restaurant. There isn’t much to say. But when at a bad restaurant, they
        are often mad and feel the need to rant. This will then increase that
        restuarants websites traffic.<br /><br />
        Geographies of Access (yes, again) and Representation<br /><br />
        This ties into my previous article on accessibility relatively well.
        When people started gaining access to technology and the internet, it
        was not as common as it is now. This means that accessing content on it
        was difficult, and uploading content was even worse. Historically, the
        demographics that have had the most power and financial control has been
        that of the cisgender, white, and male persuasion. Though this is not an
        accurate reflection of demographics accessing the internet currently, it
        still has had a long-lasting impact.

        It seems that nowadays younger people of colour have access to the
        internet and are often more active on certain sites like Twitter than
        their white counterparts. However, if we look at the older people today
        that have access to the internet or understand how to use it, the rates
        of usage are far lower. There are no studies that were done back when
        the internet was first around to see the exact people using it more, but
        this could be chalked up to lack of documentation rather than denying
        the existence of the issue. Of course there weren’t studies monitoring
        the people posting online and whether they were minorities, as the
        people in the positions of power at the time would not have thought it
        important to know. Looking at the older generations current usage of the
        internet, we can attempt to draw conclusions about who had more access
        to the internet. People tend to dislike new technology as they age, as
        it is seen as new things to learn about. This means that by looking at
        the rate at which older generations access the internet and separating
        them by target demographics, we can assume that minorities did not have
        the same levels of access to the internet as they probably would have
        liked to have. <br /><br />As you can see in the table showing the
        specific demographics of African American users and White users, there
        are certain subsections within which the divide grows larger or smaller.
        The gap in regards to age are insignificant in the younger ages (18 –
        49), but grows significantly after that. Those who attended the same
        college or university had the same internet usage rates, but when the
        level of education was restricted to high school or less, black people
        had far less access to the internet than their white counterparts.
        Parents also had less access to the internet than their children on
        average. This fits in with the age divide. Something to note is not that
        there are certain areas in which the difference is not significant, but
        instead that there are no areas in which African American people have
        more access than white people to the internet. <br /><br />Geographies
        of Representation, isolated:<br /><br />
        If you look at the above section, it is easy to see why there is a lack
        of representation of certain parts of the world and different opinions
        from people. The lack of access is quite a slippery slope into a lack of
        representation. This is due to the fact that if people do not have
        access to technology and do not have a solid understanding of using it,
        then how would they be able to feel comfortable or welcome posting about
        their individual experience? The augmented map showing the IPR {internet
        penetration rate} is extremely skewed, and this is why. I argue that the
        sections of this critical writing need not be separated at all, as they
        all lead into one another. Countries without participation, will
        automatically have lower rates off accessibility for all, which
        ultimately leads to a lack of representation.<a

        <br /><br />Why are certain places so ‘behind’?<br /><br />
        Now I can do my own three sections (adapted from those above) to
        elaborate. Certain areas are behind because of the three A’s:
        Affordability, Accessibility, and Absence of language. Electronics
        aren’t the most affordable products in the world, and if you have to
        choose between 3 months of groceries or a tablet…chances are, the people
        in an impoverished area would like choose the groceries. What if they
        can afford technology? Well, that doesn’t mean they know how to use it!
        Accessibility is keeping those who are fortunate enough to be able to
        afford to access the internet, off of the internet. Finally: Absence of
        language, which is not Aptly named because I wanted Alliteration. The
        lack of non-European language support for technology keeps those who
        tick the previous two categories, away. This issue is interesting. If
        you look at countries with the most official languages, the first three
        are Zimbabwe, India, and South Africa – all areas considered part of the
        global south.
