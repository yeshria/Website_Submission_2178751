        Themes Covered in the course:
      </h1>
      <p class="p-note">
        This course was very informative, and engaging. On the technical side we had the most patient lecturer ever, 
        always willing to explain more than necessary and willing to go the extra mile. On the critical writings side, 
        we had a lecturer that could speak about the same topic for over an hour, always finding different ways to explain 
        the same thing. 
        <br />In general, the themes we covered ranged from the beginning of the internet and what a URL actually 
        meant (which honestly...I had never really thought would be interesting but yet somehow it was.) to the internet today 
        and how we can use it to track patterns and become exposed to and more knowledgeable about injustices that otherwise 
        would have gone without notice. The writings always required engaging in the reading of the week and often required 
        further research which of course increased knowledge. 

        <br />

        The technical side of the course was very informative as well. Learning how to create structures of websites using HTML and why the 
        foundation is important. Using CSS to decorate is a rabbithole we were warned not to fall down, but I fell down it anyway and enjoyed it thoroughly. Finally, 
        I was pleased to learn JavaScript as it is an up-and-coming language and more and more companies require their employees to know how to 
        code using JavaScript or jQuery. Seeing how you could keep all of these languages seperate, and linking them together to form one cohesive unit was 
        fascinating, as it felt like finally seeing how the inside of a well-oiled machine works.

       This is the final blog post required (well..not mandatory required, but suggested required) for this course 
       as it is meant to be a reflection on the themes. I do think that the themes of this course was very much like the 
       internet itself: Overall, held together by the knowledge that it is related to the internet and coding, but so full of oppertunities 
       to learn extra things, fall down rabbit holes, find things that we didn't know existed, and allowed us to get specialised knowledge on specific topics.
