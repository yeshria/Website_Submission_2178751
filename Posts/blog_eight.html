      <h1 class="heading">Why the JS Library?</h1>
      <p class="p-note">
        Why did I choose such a simple JS library? It is merely an elevator that takes the user to the top of the page. Why?
        Well, there is a lot of beauty in simplicity. And here I will explain why.

        <br /><br />
        <h2>What are JS Libraries?</h2>
        <br />
        JavaScript libraries (not necessarily the external ones) are sets of code that can be implemented in multiple
         projects without having to copy and paste large blocks of code in each page. They are simple to implement. 
         You simply download the necessary files, link it in the script-header section of your project, and then 
         call the functions as they are needed. They are essentially functions that you can download and add to your project without 
         having to code them yourself. You can write your own javascript function and include it as a library, but for this brief we had 
         to use an external library, meaning not coded by ourselves.
        
        <br /><br />
        <h2>Other JS Libraries</h2>
        <br />
        I went down quite a rabbit hole when looking into these external JavaScript libraries. There were many JS libraries that I looked 
        into before deciding which one to use. Some of them I contemplated using, like 
       anime.js, which allows you to create animations easily. With this I considered making the vines on the blog pages 
       move and grow like real vines. However, this would then be distracting for the reader. Next, I looked at easter eggs, which makes an animation happen when the user
       types in a word. This, however cool it may be, wouldn't fit the aesthetic or add anything to the user experience. I looked at SweetAlert, which
       allows you to add quick and easy alerts to any page. But my website is a portfolio website. There isn't anything the user would be doing that would warrant an alert. This is 
       when I realized that adding a JS library to my project that enhanced the UX without derailing from the themes I had created...would be very difficult, if not impossible.
        <br /><br />
        <h2>Elevator Library</h2>
        <br />
       So I used Elevator. What? Why? It's so simple to use, surely this doesn't improve anything. Wrong! It doesn't include any visuals, so I knew
        going into it that it wouldn't disrupt my websites flow. It is a very cute back-to-the-top button that functions like an elevator, so I thought I would 
        use it on the pages that are quite long so that the user has a fun way of getting back to the top. But Yeshria, you say perplexed, WHY??
        <br /><br />
        <h2>but...Why?!</h2>
        <br />
        I don't like adding things for the sake of adding things. Adding a library for brief fulfillment is great, but I wanted 
        to ensure that it fits my website, it doesn't feel like a random element, and it didn't change the overall flow.
         Since it doesn't add visuals, not only could I control what the user sees, but also it acts as a quick overview of the page. 
         Seeing how much the user read could be motivating for them. Elevator also allows you to add your own 'elevator music', allowing 
         me to play any soft, feminine music I want that will (fit with? Nay!) enhance the user experience.
        <br /><br />
        <h2>Justified enough?</h2>
        <br />
        I sure do hope so! :)
