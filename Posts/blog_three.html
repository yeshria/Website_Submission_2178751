      <p>
        Why a bridge? It's to help people cross the digital divide, which is far
        harder to cross than any canyon or gorge.<br /><br />The discussion on
        why inclusivity is important in online spaces should always be preceded
        with the true question and topic this addresses: Why is inclusivity
        important? This seems like a simple question with a simple answer, but
        the truth is nothing is simple in the digital space. On a biological
        level, the sense of ‘belonging’ is important to prevent loneliness,
        depression, and other negative mental health effects.

        In a more academic sense, inclusivity is important because everyone
        deserves to contribute to discussions that impact their lives, and to
        engage with others in a meaningful way in online spaces. <br /><br />The
        question of inclusivity in the digital age could be better worded as
        “Can a person with no prior knowledge of websites use this website
        effectively?” <br /><br />When we become accustomed to something, we
        tend to forget that not everyone has been exposed to it their entire
        lives. The perfect example for this is, well…the internet! For young
        adults, we cannot imagine what life was like before the internet
        existed. We see three dots and immediately know “Hey! The meatballs menu
        symbol means more options will appear if you click on it :)” but how
        would someone without this knowledge figure this out?
        <br /><br />{Thankfully, we can look at examples in real life: the
        meatball menu looks just like a set of ellipses, which is typically used
        to mean “hey this sentence is continuing” so people might have that
        association with it. The discussion of how things in the digital space
        relate to things in the real world should be explored to promote
        inclusion.}<br /><br />Inclusivity doesn’t just refer to age; it also
        refers to race, gender, religion, and other things that people perceive
        as ‘dividing’ us. Poverty and race often plays a role in access to
        broadband, or comfort levels when using technology.

        </a>
        In conclusion, this is an ongoing issue that will only morph with time,
        and we need to work to make sites more comprehensible to those not
        tech-savvy.
