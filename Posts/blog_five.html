        Graham et al’s “Toward a study of information geographies” A suggested
        alternative title: We needed a study for this?
      </h1>
      <p>
        Graham et al’s “Toward a study of information geographies” (which will
        be referred to as the paper for the rest of this piece) claims to be
        studying the distribution of information geographically, and to look at
        factors like access and representation.
        <br /><br />Information has to come from a source, therefore it will
        always have a geographical location of origin. The validity of the
        information, the participation, and the distribution has changed over
        time as the main media for accessing information has changed. The
        article/paper breaks this down into three distinct sections: geographies
        of access and enablement, geographies of participation, and geographies
        of representation. In this mini-essay, I will be discussing all of these
        in detail. <br /><br />{I’m not going to quote statistics from the paper
        back at you, the reader, as that doesn’t feel like a critical writing
        piece. Instead, I am merely here to describe the concepts, talk about
        conclusions, and maybe offer my own opinions. We were told to provide a
        ‘close reading’ and this is described to be a quick overview of relevant
        themes in a paper, not more than two to three paragraphs in length. I
        shall attempt to keep this as short, concise, and informative as
        possible.} Fun Fact!: The ‘Global South’ is a term used to refer to all
        countries that are considered third-world. These are (coincidentally)
        also the countries where colonialism had a long-term impact. Probably
        not relevant though.<br /><br />
        Geographies of Access and Enablement: What are the geographies of Access
        and Enablement? It is a “map” showing the amount of people who have
        access to the internet and in which regions they are accessing the
        internet from. It is different from a traditional population map as just
        because an area has a large population, this does not always mean they
        all have access to the internet. In an ideal world and perfect utopia,
        everyone would be able to have equal say and influence on the world
        around them, but the sad truth is this isn’t so. Often, to be able to
        have an opinion, you will need to have access to information on whatever
        the topic at hand is. Not only that, but the content conveyed by a
        single person in real life will not be heard by many….but that same
        content online will reach (at the very least) dozens.
        <br /><br />Geographies of Participation: This section is exactly what
        it sounds like: the amount of people in each country that
        ‘participates/contributes’ to the internet. This means uploading content
        to the internet, be it through GitHub, or YouTube. Once again, in the
        perfect world, everyone would be able to express every thought and
        participate in online debates freely, but this isn’t always the case.
        <br /><br />This does bring me to an interesting tangent of censorship:
        Where do we draw the line? We say everyone should participate freely
        online, however does this mean we should condone hate speech? Racism?
        Sexism? Islamophobia? This is exactly what the paradox of tolerance
        involves. The tolerant do not draw a line, and thus often tolerate
        intolerance. But the intolerant obviously do not provide the same luxury
        to the tolerant. This is not quite related to the content, but does
        definitely make one wonder about participation in general. In that same
        vein, often the countries with the highest participation rates are the
        same countries with higher rates of hate-fueled crimes. Accessibility is
        a blessing, but in the wrong hands can truly be a curse.
        <br /><br />Geography of Representation This ties into my previous
        article on accessibility relatively well. When Why are certain places so
        ‘behind’? Now I can do my own three sections (adapted from those above)
        to elaborate. <br /><br />Certain areas are behind because of the three
        A’s: Affordability, Accessibility, and Absence of language.
        <br /><br />Electronics aren’t the most affordable products in the
        world, and if you have to choose between 3 months of groceries or a
        tablet…chances are, the people in an impoverished area would like choose
        the groceries. What if they can afford technology? Well, that doesn’t
        mean they know how to use it! Accessibility is keeping those who are
        fortunate enough to be able to afford to access the internet, off of the
        internet. Finally: Absence of language, which is not Aptly named because
        I wanted Alliteration. The lack of non-European language support for
        technology keeps those who tick the previous two categories, away. This
        issue is interesting. If you look at countries with the most official
        languages, the first three are Zimbabwe, India, and South Africa – all
        areas considered part of the global south.
