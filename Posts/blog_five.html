        Time to talk about the complicated relaitonship between UX, UI, and me
        :)
        <br /><br />
        <h2>UX {User Experience}</h2>
        <br /><br />
        The user experience is quite difficult to define and work within. Every
        person is different. Someone might love comic sans, and another might be
        normal and the mere sight of that font induces rage. UX is one of the
        few things you work towards cultivating that might still have a negative
        impact after it is up and running, as thehuman experience is so vast.
        Enough about what it is and why it varies, time to look at my own UX and
        critically analyse it.
        <br /><br />
        <h2>My UX? </h2>
        <br /><br />
        My goal for the UX of my site was to put the user into a calmer state,
        to hopefully increase their confidence in my abilities, and to show them
        my skills in a way that doesn't feel too aggresive. I used a light pink,
        water-stain patterned background for all of my pages as pink is seen as
        girlish and soft.

        also represents inner harmony and approachability, which is what I would
        want a future employer to think of when seeing me. Vines and floral
        patterns are scattered here and there to relax the user
        <a href="https://www.tattooseo.com/vine-tattoos/">as they imply</a>
        qualities like strength, partnership, and progress. They also grow
        upwards, quite literally showing growth and hopefully the user wil
        correlate that with professional and academic growth. <br /><br />
        Of course this is all just my ideas and experiences that I am attempting
        to make the user feel with no knowledge of their lives. They could have
        a crippling fear of vines, or hate the colour pink. Then regardless of
        my research into symbolism, they will not have the experience I am
        attempting to induce. 
        <br /><br />
        <h2>And UI? </h2>
        <br /><br />
        Well....UI is another case entirely. Making a clear, readable user
        interface was my goal for all sections except one - the blogs section. I
        wanted a future employer to be able to scan through my skills page and
        get all of the knowledge they require from a glance, hence my use of
        graphs. But my blog pages...I wanted those to be a bit trickier. I read
        that people absorb information better when it is presented to them in a
        font that is unusual on the eyes, as it forces them to focus more. This
        sounded like a bad UIX choice, as the user would notice the change in
        font and probably think it is bad design instead of a conscious
        decision. So instead, I right-aligned the text for all blog pages. This
        is also a bit unusual on the eyes, but a more subtle way to do it. This
        combined with the lack of a navigation bar on each page, forces the
        reader to actually pay attention to what is on the screen in front of
        them. The horizontal green vines encourage vertical eye movement as
        well. I ended up adding navigation (as you can see) but kept it very plain and simple to look at to avoid distracting the user.
        <br /><br />
        Of course there is plenty of bad as well. I typically look at the
        positive aspects of things as whoever marks my work will be forced to
        look for the negative, so laying it out for them feels strange. But I
        can honestly say I think I improved from my first iteration of my site
        to my second iteration. And that is all that matters (to me, at least)
