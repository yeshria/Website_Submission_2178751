      <h2 class="designheaders">A list of explanations on design choices</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Why pink?</strong> Pink is often seen as a sign of femininity
          and thus rarely associated with technology, or anything in STEM. As a
          human that loves the colour, I decided to use it to break convention
          :)
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Why vines/greenery?</strong> Also something not often
          associated with technology, as progress often causes people to neglect
          nature.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Why informal language?</strong> Because it's a rough draft of
          the final product, and I see no use in refining language when I could
          be learning or designing better. So...it will be formal. Just not yet
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Why the background change for the blogs?</strong> Because I
          felt like the vines on each side focuses the eye on the content in the
          center, thus promoting reading with more concentration.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Why no navigation bar for the blogs?</strong> Once again, that
          provides extra details that the reader doesn't need to absorb the
          information from the article. Also, when getting bored in the middle
          of an article, if the option to exit and go back to a portfolio page
          is right there...often users will go for it as it is within their line
          of vision. Out of sight, out of mind
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Why the previous and next buttons on the blog pages?</strong>
          Well...people often binge media content due to the rise in popular
          streaming sites like Netflix. If someone is enjoying the writing, or
          even just the content, they might want to continue reading all
          previous posts, or posts that were made after the one they are
          currently on. There is also a button to return them to the main blog
          page.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Why wireframes font so chill?</strong> Because! Wireframes aer
          often sketched out. Thus....sketchy/handwriting-y font :)
