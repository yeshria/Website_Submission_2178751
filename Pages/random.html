      linking games doesn't feel adequate and I'm not an art student so.. this will defs morph over time.

      <h2 class="skillhead">Great at Coding</h2>
      <p class="skillpar">
        I have three years of coding experience in C++, C# and Delphi, as well
        as one year of coding experience in HTML. I am currently learning
        Terminal, JavaScript and CSS. C# is the language that I am most
        confident in as I have written code for multiple games using C# in
        Unity. I was chosen as one of two women at my school to be sent to join
        the YAWiC {Young African Women in Computing} group.
      </p>

      <h3 class="skillhead">Leadership Skills/Dictator Vibes</h3>
      <p class="skillpar">
        I perform well in leadership roles and I enjoy meeting new people. I
        have a Toastmasters qualification and enjoy public speaking. An example
        of both my leadership skills and love of public speaking would be the
        time I was invited to speak at the Vision Mission on Mandela day as a
        youth leader.
      </p>

      <h4 class="skillhead">Analytical Skills</h4>
      <p class="skillpar">
        Due to my love of coding, I am proficient at solving issues in unique
        ways, and have become adept in observing information and finding
        patterns. I decided to go into the engineering digital arts field as it
        balances creative problem-solving with structured, logical engineering
        skills. I received gold award for the Computer Talent Search in 2017,
        which was largely based on creative problem-solving.
