      <p><strong>Why a bridge?</strong> <br/><br/>It's to help people cross the digital divide, which is far
        harder to cross than any canyon or gorge. The discussion on why inclusivity is important in online spaces should always be preceded with the true question and topic this addresses: Why is inclusivity important? This seems like a simple question with a simple answer, but the truth is nothing is simple in the digital space.
        The question of inclusivity in the digital age could be better worded as: <br/><br/><strong>“Can a person with no prior knowledge of websites use this website effectively?” </strong>

          As established in the piece, “The human mind operates through
          association.“ This is a sentence that stuck with me after the reading
          due to its increasing relevance in our everyday lives, and is a key
          concept to remember when designing and examining algorithms.

        <h6 class="blogdate">Posted: no clue</h5>
        <p>
          A URL {or Uniform Resource Locator, if you are a nerd} is the website
          name followed by a line of seemingly random letters that you will find
          in the address bar. I could describe what it means, but it literally
          says it in the name – it locates resources in the form of webpages, on
          the internet.
